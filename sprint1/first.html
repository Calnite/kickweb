            I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
            For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground
            I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
            When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned
        </div>
        <div class="pg-2">
            Tell you you're the greatest
            But once you turn they hate us

        <div class="pg-3">
        Oh, the misery
        Everybody wants to be my enemy
        Spare the sympathy
        Everybody wants to be
        My enemy (look, look, look, look)

        My enemy (look, look, look, look)

        Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall
        And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called
        I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time
        When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
        Tell you you're the greatest
        But once you turn they hate us
        </div>
        <div class="huh-1">huh</div>

        Uh, look
        Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
        I'm praying that somebody hope for me
        I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
        P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions
        Ready to go whenever, just let me know
        The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
        The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
        I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
        They wanna plot on my trot to the top
        I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
        I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
        And it matters more because I had it not
        Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
        Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic
        Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
        Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
        Batter, batter up, who the baddest?
        It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat
